## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (>= 1.19)

### Installation

To install the Candy CLI, use the command `go install github.com/Pradumnasaraf/candy@latest`.

Go will automatically install it in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory, which should be in your `$PATH`.

Once installed, you can use the `candy` CLI command. To confirm installation, type `candy` at the command line.

> **Note** If you are getting an error like `command not found: candy`, then you need to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH` environment variable. For that you can refer to [this](https://gist.github.com/Pradumnasaraf/ca6f9a0507089a4c44881446cdda4aa3)
